# Recursion in Programming

## Introduction
Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. It provides an elegant and concise way to solve complex problems by dividing them into simpler instances. This README file provides an overview of recursion, its implementation, and common use cases.

## What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself during its execution. Instead of using iterative loops, recursion breaks a problem down into smaller, similar subproblems and solves them independently. Each recursive call solves a smaller subproblem until a base case is reached, which is a condition that terminates the recursion.

## How Recursion Works
When a function is called recursively, it creates a new instance of itself with a separate set of local variables. The recursive calls form a chain of function calls, each operating on a smaller part of the problem. This process continues until the base case is reached, at which point the recursion unwinds, and the results of each recursive call are combined to solve the original problem.

## Base Case and Recursive Case
Recursion requires two essential components: a base case and a recursive case.
- The base case is the condition that terminates the recursion. It defines the simplest form of the problem that can be solved directly without further recursion.
- The recursive case defines the larger problem in terms of smaller subproblems. It breaks down the problem into simpler instances that can be solved by recursively calling the same function.
