# Static, If-Else, and While Loops in Programming

## Introduction
Static variables, if-else statements, and while loops are important components in programming languages that allow for conditional execution and repetitive tasks. This README file provides an overview of static variables, if-else statements, and while loops, along with their usage and benefits.

## Static Variables
Static variables are a type of variable that retains their value between function calls. Unlike local variables, which are re-initialized each time a function is called, static variables preserve their values, allowing for persistence of data across function invocations. They are commonly used to keep track of state or count occurrences.

## If-Else Statements
If-else statements provide conditional execution in programming. They allow you to specify different blocks of code to be executed based on a given condition. If the condition evaluates to true, the code within the "if" block is executed. Otherwise, the code within the "else" block (if present) is executed. If-else statements enable branching and decision-making in programs.
