# Preprocessors

Preprocessors are tools or programs that perform preprocessing tasks on source code before it is compiled or interpreted. They are widely used in various programming languages to modify the source code at a preprocessing stage, allowing for more flexible and powerful code generation.

## What is a Preprocessor?

A preprocessor is a software tool that performs transformations on the source code before the compilation or interpretation process. It works by scanning the source code and applying predefined directives or commands to modify the code.

Common tasks performed by preprocessors include:

- Text replacement
- Conditional compilation
- File inclusion
- Macro expansion

Preprocessors are often used to simplify coding tasks, enable code reuse, and customize code behavior based on specific conditions.

## Common Preprocessors

Different programming languages have their own specific preprocessors. Here are some well-known preprocessors:

- C/C++: The C preprocessor (`cpp`) is commonly used to handle conditional compilation, macro expansion, and file inclusion.
- Python: The Python preprocessor (`pypp`) allows for code generation and conditional inclusion of code sections.
- JavaScript: Tools like Babel enable preprocessing features like transpiling modern JavaScript syntax into older versions for compatibility.
- HTML: Templating engines like Handlebars and Pug offer preprocessing capabilities for generating dynamic HTML content.
- CSS: Preprocessors like Sass and Less provide features like variables, mixins, and nesting, which are compiled into regular CSS.
