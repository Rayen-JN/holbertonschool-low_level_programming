# Hash Table Readme

A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides efficient insertion, retrieval, and deletion of values based on their keys. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Basic Operations

A hash table supports the following basic operations:

1. **Insertion:** Add a key-value pair to the hash table. The hash table uses the key to determine the index where the value should be stored.

2. **Retrieval:** Given a key, retrieve the corresponding value from the hash table.

3. **Deletion:** Remove a key-value pair from the hash table based on the provided key.
