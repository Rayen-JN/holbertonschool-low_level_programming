# Command-Line Arguments: argc and argv

## Introduction

When running a C program from the command line, you can pass additional arguments to the program. The arguments can be accessed within the program using the `argc` and `argv` parameters. This README file provides an overview of `argc` and `argv`, how to use them, and common use cases.

## What are argc and argv?

In C, `argc` is an integer variable that represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program, including the program name itself. `argv` is an array of strings (character pointers) that stores the actual command-line arguments.

## Accessing Command-Line Arguments

The `argc` and `argv` parameters are typically declared in the `main` function.
