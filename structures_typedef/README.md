# Struct Readme

## Introduction

Welcome to the Struct Readme! This document provides an overview of structs in programming and how they are used in various programming languages.

## What is a Struct?

A struct, short for structure, is a composite data type used in programming to group related data together. It allows you to create a custom data type that can hold multiple variables of different types. Each variable within a struct is called a member or a field.

## Purpose of Structs

Structs are used for organizing and representing related data in a cohesive manner. They provide a way to encapsulate data and associate it with specific attributes or properties. By grouping variables together within a struct, you can create complex data structures that mirror real-world objects, concepts, or entities.

## Syntax

The syntax for creating a struct varies depending on the programming language. Here are a few examples:
