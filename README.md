## Pointers

The "Pointers" directory includes examples and explanations of C pointers. It covers pointer declaration, dereferencing, pointer arithmetic, and their practical applications.

## Recursion

The "Recursion" directory contains code samples demonstrating recursive functions in C. It explores recursive algorithms, their benefits, and potential pitfalls to avoid.

## Dynamic Memory Allocation

The "Dynamic Memory Allocation" directory focuses on using `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` functions for dynamic memory management in C. It provides examples and best practices for efficient memory allocation and deallocation.

## File Handling

The "File Handling" directory showcases C programming techniques for reading from and writing to files. It covers file I/O operations, error handling, and file manipulation.

## Data Structures

The "Data Structures" directory explores the implementation of common data structures in C. It includes examples of linked lists, stacks, queues, and more, along with their associated operations.
