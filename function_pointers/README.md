# Function Pointer

## Introduction

Function pointers in C are variables that store the address of a function. They provide a way to indirectly reference and invoke functions, enabling more flexible and dynamic programming. This README file provides an overview of function pointers, their declaration, assignment, and usage, along with some common use cases.

## What is a Function Pointer?

A function pointer in C is a variable that stores the memory address of a function. It allows you to treat functions as data and enables dynamic function invocation. Function pointers are particularly useful in scenarios where you need to select and call functions at runtime based on certain conditions or parameters.

## Declaring a Function Pointer

To declare a function pointer, you need to specify the return type and parameter types of the function it points to.
