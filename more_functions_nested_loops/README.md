# Function Nested Loop

## Introduction
Nested loops are a programming construct that involves placing one loop inside another loop. This allows for repeated execution of a block of code within the inner loop, which is then repeated for each iteration of the outer loop. This README file provides an overview of nested loops within functions and how to use them effectively.

## What are Nested Loops?
Nested loops are a way to perform repetitive tasks in a structured and organized manner. They allow you to iterate over a set of values using an outer loop and, for each iteration of the outer loop, perform a set of operations using an inner loop. This nesting can continue to any level, depending on the complexity of the problem you are solving.

## Syntax of Nested Loops
The basic syntax of nested loops involves placing one loop inside another loop.
