# Static Libraries

## Introduction
Static libraries are a way to bundle compiled object code and related resources into a single archive file. They provide a convenient means of packaging and reusing code in various software projects. This README file provides an overview of static libraries, their creation, usage, and benefits.

## What is a Static Library?
A static library, also known as an archive library, is a collection of precompiled object code (.o files) and related resources bundled into a single file. It contains functions, variables, and other symbols that can be linked with an executable program during the compilation process. Static libraries are distinguished from dynamic libraries, which are loaded at runtime.

## Creating a Static Library
To create a static library, you typically follow these steps:

1. Compile the source code files (*.c) into object files (*.o) using a compiler like GCC:
