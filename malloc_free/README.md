# Memory Allocation and Deallocation: malloc and free

## Introduction
In C programming, managing memory dynamically is a crucial task. The functions `malloc` and `free` play a vital role in allocating and freeing memory dynamically. This README file provides an overview of `malloc` and `free`, their usage, and considerations for memory management.

## What is `malloc`?
`malloc` (short for "memory allocation") is a function in the C standard library that dynamically allocates a specified number of bytes from the heap. It returns a pointer to the allocated memory block or `NULL` if the allocation fails.

## Allocating Memory with `malloc`
To allocate memory dynamically using `malloc`, you need to specify the number of bytes to be allocated.
